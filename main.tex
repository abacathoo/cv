%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

\subsection{\normalsize Technical Skills \footnotesize Programming Languages}
\href{c.com}{C/C$++$}, \href{java.com}{Java}, \href{ml.com}{ML}, \href{prolog.com}{Prolog}, and \href{sysver.com}{System Verilog} were the major languages taught as part of my undergraduate degree. \href{bash.com}{Bash}, \href{matlab.com}{Matlab}, and \href{perl.com}{Perl} were taught in the context of their use in \href{unix.com}{UNIX} systems. I have used \href{haskell.com}{Haskell}, \href{python.com}{Python} and \href{vb6.com}{Visual Basic} in my own projects. Working on web projects has given me a good understanding of \href{javascript.com}{Javascript}, \href{html.com}{HTML}, \href{php.com}{PHP}, and \href{sql.com}{SQL}.




I have basic knowledge of historical languages such as \href{algol.com}{Algol}, \href{fortran.com}{Fortran},  and \href{smalltalk.com}{Smalltalk}. 
I understand the compromises (safe/un-safe, typed/un-typed, call-by-value/call-by-name/call-by-need) involved in the design of languages. I have studied these concepts formally as part of \href{types.com}{Type Theory} and \href{op.com}{Operational}/\href{de.com}{Denotational} Semantics. 

\subsection{Code Style \& Documentation}
I am versatile and have had to quickly adopt the different styles employed in large code-bases ??? with strict documentation and coding styles???? during my internships.***  I document code as I write it, and am used to using documentation generation tools such as \href{junit.com}{JUnit}.

\subsection{Libraries \& Tools}
I have studied the theory of \href{cl.ac.uk}{Concurrent \& Distributed Systems} and can write thread safe code using built-in Java concurrency constructs and the \href{pthreads.com}{pthreads} library in C/C$++$. I use the C$++$ \href{stl.com}{Standard Template Library} including \href{TF1.com}{TF1}. In a web development context, I have experience with \href{ajax.com}{Ajax}, \href{drupal.com}{Drupal} \href{node.js}{node.js} \& \href{websockets.com}{Websockets}.
I am comfortable in a \href{linux.com}{Linux}, \href{mac.com}{Macintosh}, or \href{windows.com}{Windows} environment. 

\subsection{Data Structures \& Algorithms}
\href{wiki.com}{Fibonacci Heaps}, \href{wiki.com}{Disjoint Sets}, \href{wiki.com}{B Trees}, \href{wiki.com}{Red Black Trees}, \href{www.tick0.com}{External $n$-way Merge Sort}, and basic data structures \& algorithms were studied during my undergraduate degree. I have implemented many of the above in C$++$ or Java. I can find asymtotic complexity bounds (expressed in big \emph{O}, $\Omega$ and $\Theta$ notation) for algorithms using standard and amortized analysis. 

\subsection{Logic \& Discrete Mathematics}
Reasoning and proof in first/second/higher order logics, temporal logics, hoare/separation logic, polymorphic lambda calculi and sequent calculi was studied during my undergraduate degree. I understand how automated theorem provers can be implemented efficiently using binary descision diagrams. 

\subsection{Specification \& Verification}
I can write specifications for program code, and prove** the code meets the specifications. I can model small software/hardware systems, and proove that the model meets a specification written in Computation Tree Logic, Linear Time Logic or PSL.

\section{Other Skills \footnotesize Teamwork}
At Lancaster University, RealVNC, and during my undergraduate group project, I was working as part of a team. I had responsibilities, deadlines to meet, client meetings and presentations to give. I have good communication skills, which were essential in these roles.

%\subsection{Law}
%I have good knowledge of the laws and regulations relevant to the IT industry***. This was obtained during my undergraduate degree and internships***.

\section{Intrests}
%
I am a senior member of \href{http://www.culrc.com}{Cambridge University Lightweight Rowing Club}. The training reigime is intense, and consists of 2 or 3 sessions per day. In 2012/2013 I shall be trialing for the Great Britain under-23 team.
I have also participated fully in society life and have skied (competitively), sailed (competitively), and sung my way through university.

%Ski at a local dry ski slope and participate in \href{www.ersa.com}{Eastern Region} races.**

%Sail a \emph{Laser I} dinghy competitively in weekly club races at a local sailing club.



%Have sung in \href{http://www.emmamusic.co.uk/index.php?page=chorus}{Emmanuel College Chorus}, performing in frequent concerts  and charity carols on street.

%Performed in \href{http://cambridge.gands.org.uk/}{Cambridge University Gilbert and Sullivan Society} operettas.**

%Danced with the \href{http://www.cambridgedancers.org/}{Cambridge Dancers Club}.**
